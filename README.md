Statistical code supporting the manuscript: "Exploration of different machine learning methods and domains of predictors for chronic post-surgical pain after video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery".

The initial redCAP database was partially coded in Danish, and some phrases were not changed to english before data was added and could therefore not be translated. Therefore, some parts of the code is in danish, but comments have been made to make the code easier to read for non-danish speakers. Should any names be unintuitive, please contact corresponding author Phillip K Sperling (phis@rn.dk) or post an issue to the repository.

The repository includes 3 documents:

Preprocess: File for processing raw data until analysis.
Statistics: The statistical analysis code for the project
Figures: Code for making the figures
